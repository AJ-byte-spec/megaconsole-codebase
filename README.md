# megaconsole-codebase
The codebase for the Megaconsole Video Game System abbreviated as MVGS or Megaconsole.

If you want to you can make a 32 bit port. But the reason I'm using 64-bit is because of the compilation speed. 
And yes, I'd be fine with sacrificing the smaller size but it's not ***THAT*** bad.

It's a .8 GB difference anyways.

Thanks to the guy who created Linux From Scratch for help in creating this with his book he made.

UPDATE: I am no longer using the LFS Book. I downloaded a video from some Indian guy.
