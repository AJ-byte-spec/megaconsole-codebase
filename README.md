# megaconsole-codebase
The codebase for the Megaconsole Video Game System abbreviated as MVGS or Megaconsole.

Thanks to the guy who created Linux From Scratch for help in creating this with his book he made.

UPDATE: I am no longer using the LFS Book. I downloaded a video from some Indian guy. 

IMPORTANT: To compile install Nasm and Qemu on a Linux VM, it's free if you stay away from VMware and RHEL.

(No ads intended)

Installation for Linux

Debian: sudo apt-get install nasm qemu
Kali: sudo apt-get satisfy nasm qemu

(IDK the rest.)
